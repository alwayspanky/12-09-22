        <h1 style="margin-top: 20px; text-align: center; color: brown;">Ubuntu is the builder’s OS of choice.</h1>
        <p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right:100px; text-align:center; font-size:larger">Whether it be from software development to machine learning data scientists and engineers, from your desktop to the cloud, from the ones who want freedom and low time to market to the ones who need security and compliance, Ubuntu has you covered!

            According to Hackerearth Developer Survey 2021, Ubuntu is the preferred Linux operating system by developers.
            
            This story applies on the cloud as well. Ubuntu is the most used third party Operating System running production workloads. Ubuntu powers more than 60% of the cloud workloads today.</p>

        <h1 class="text-heading">Ubuntu is secure by design.</h1>
        <p class="paragraph-style">Did you know that according to a study done this year by Synopsys with over 2,400 commercial codebases, 78% of code reviewed was open source, which shows that open source is everywhere! The study revealed that  88% of these codebases contained components with outdated versions with 81% containing at least one vulnerability. The main reasons for these vulnerabilities were that the majority of the reviewed apps were either running with components over 4 years or had no updates from the vendor. If you recall equifax’s data breach or log4j vulnerability episode, you will understand the danger this poses.<br><br>

            This shows that security should be prioritized not only in enterprises but everyone. Having a way to get in-call-support, committed or SLA’d maintenance and enterprise compliance is more critical than ever. Nobody should  deploy an open source application with no support or further maintenance. Just imagine. What happens if tomorrow someone discovers a security vulnerability on a package in your app?</p>
